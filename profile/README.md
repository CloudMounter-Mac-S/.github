## Overview

Cloud storage services provide convenient online file storage but accessing files typically requires web browsers or dedicated applications consuming screen space. <a href="#">CloudMounter</a> eliminates this friction by mounting cloud storage as local drives making remote files accessible through Finder like local storage. This integration streamlines workflows treating remote storage identically to local drives.

Multiple cloud service support encompasses major providers including Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, and Amazon S3. Users mount multiple accounts simultaneously accessing all cloud storage through <a href="#">unified interface</a>. This consolidation eliminates switching between different cloud applications for file access reducing context switching overhead.

File operations proceed identically to local file handling with drag-and-drop copying, moving, renaming, and deleting working seamlessly. Applications open cloud files directly without manual <a href="#">download steps</a> maintaining familiar interaction patterns. This transparency enables working with cloud files as though stored locally.

Encryption support protects data during transmission and while stored in cloud services. Client-side encryption ensures file security before upload preventing unauthorized access even if <a href="#">cloud accounts</a> become compromised. This security layer proves essential for sensitive data stored in cloud services.

Bandwidth management controls upload and download speeds preventing cloud synchronization from consuming entire network capacity. Speed limits ensure other network activities remain responsive while cloud operations proceed in <a href="#">background</a>. This traffic control maintains system usability during large cloud transfers.

Offline access caches frequently used files locally enabling continued work without internet connectivity. Cached files remain accessible during network outages with changes synchronizing once <a href="#">connection restores</a>. This offline capability ensures productivity despite intermittent connectivity.

The application handles large file transfers efficiently supporting uploads and downloads of multi-gigabyte files. Progress tracking shows transfer status while resume capabilities recover from <a href="#">interrupted transfers</a>. This reliability proves essential for working with substantial cloud-stored data.

Connection management maintains stable connections to cloud services handling authentication, session renewal, and error recovery automatically. Users remain connected without manual <a href="#">intervention</a> as application handles connection maintenance transparently. This automation eliminates frustrating repeated login requirements.

WebDAV protocol support enables mounting any WebDAV-compatible server as local drive. This flexibility extends beyond mainstream cloud providers to private servers and specialized storage services supporting <a href="#">standard protocols</a>. Protocol versatility accommodates diverse storage infrastructures.

Menu bar integration provides quick access to mount controls, connection status, and settings without launching full application window. Compact interface enables managing cloud <a href="#">connections</a> efficiently while maintaining minimal screen space consumption. This unobtrusive access supports focused workflow continuation.
